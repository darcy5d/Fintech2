## Who Am I? What is my background
My name is Darcy Davis.  I currently work as a commodity trader for the world's largest renewable fuel company.
I've always had an interest in geopolitics and finance, and had a gap in my knowledge with tech so that's why I am here

## What are my career goals
I want to stay ahead of the curve.  The managers of the future will need to to understand coding, big data, algorythms, Deep Learning and AI.  I want to be able to guide these activities without doing the grunt work

## Why did I choose FinTech as a career?
I decided my current job wasn't stressful enough
